        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for
        documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by
        technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
        such as JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p id="css">
        Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the
        presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or
        XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML
        and JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p id="js">
        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
        conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing,
        prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
        multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
        programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
        working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
        and the Document Object Model (DOM).
